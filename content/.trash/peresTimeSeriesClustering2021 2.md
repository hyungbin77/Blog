> Ever since the worldwide demand for gambling services started to spread, its expansion has continued steadily. To wit, online gambling is a major industry in every European country, generating billions of Euros in revenue for commercial actors and governments alike. Despite such evidently beneÔ¨Åcial effects, online gambling is ultimately a vast social experiment with potentially disastrous social and personal consequences that could result in an overall deterioration of social and familial relationships. Despite the relevance of this problem in society, there is a lack of tools for characterizing the behavior of online gamblers based on the data that are collected daily by betting platforms. This paper uses a time series clustering algorithm that can help decision-makers in identifying behaviors associated with potential pathological gamblers. In particular, experimental results obtained by analyzing sports event bets and black jack data demonstrate the suitability of the proposed method in detecting critical (i.e., pathological) players. This algorithm is the Ô¨Årst component of a system developed in collaboration with the Portuguese authority for the control of betting activities.

- & It is also important to inspect the relationships of the final balance with respect to the number of bets placed and the amount spent presented in Figure 6. From these plots, we can observe two things:  ‚Ä¢ gamblers who have a positive balance tend to have a low number of placed bets, while only a few playe [(p. 11)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YAZGJURA?page=11&annotation=N3DVZHP7)

It would be more appropriate to say that both clusters include both professional and pathological gamblers, who belong to one of the two clusters based on the ‚Äúlevel‚Äù of the disease.
